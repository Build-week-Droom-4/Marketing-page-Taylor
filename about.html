        <h2>Empowering Employment Across the Globe</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is empowering employment. We are striving to organize all
          the world’s human capital data and make it meaningful for society. It
          is the core of our business and the guiding principle of our people,
          making Droom a truly unique place to work. A place where you can say
          that at the end of the day, you make a difference. Each day we help
          job seekers and companies connect, giving people a chance to find
          their calling and many employers a chance to find and hire top talent
          to help grow their business.
